#Birdie notes
## General Notes:
* BNB Combos
  + CLK -> LK -> Headbutt
  + CHP -> HK chain is the best hard punish
  + SLK -> SLP -> LBHead
* SHK
  - Great follow-up after successful anti-air
    + 5 frames to follow up
      - LK -> Bull Head
      - Super
    + Great to bait Crush Counter
* anti-air
  - MP by far best option
  - HP chain is risky
  - follow-up
    + HK best option
    + HK -> Super
    + HK -> LP -> LBHead
  - Command grab isn't a terrible way to go
* Save meter for
  - EX Bull horn is great because of armor
  - Super does great damage
  - EX bull head while v-trigger active gives crazy armor
* Wake up options
  - This is one of Birdie's worst weakesses
  - Ex-bullhorn
    + Great option
    + Timing is hard
    + CAN be smacked out of it
* Bull-Horn
  - Awful except for EX
* Can
  - Use at full screen
  - Slow, use with caution
  - EX-BullRevenger just before block is a good trick
  - Dash in -> Command grab while block stun
* Bananna peel is bad. It's BARELY fewer frames, and just doesn't pay off
* Command grab
  - Light version longer range
* Mix-Ups
  - MP -> LBR
    + Super cheesy, but works
    + Be careful, super punishable
    + EX works too
    + Mix up with HP -> chain if they are neutral jumping out of it
* V-Gauge
  - V-Reversal
    + USE IT!!!
    + Tends to be better than v-trigger
    + Great to get people to back off while rushing down
  - v-trigger
    + Better in some matchups (Nash, Dhalsim)
    + Adds armor to many moves
    + Ex moves have crazy armor, abuse during fireball spam
* Super
  - Pretty good
  - Great situational AA
    + AA -> HK -> Super
## Matchups
* Nash
  - Worst Matchup by far
  - Do not jump in, will be punished by crescent kick
  - Walk forward, take the chip damage from sonic boom spam
  - FHP at close range to punish spam
  - EX Bull horn is your friend in this Matchup
  - Worth it to v-trigger for armor on bull heads
* Dhalsim
  - hard
  - grab limbs with LK-Chain
  - FHP is again, my friend
  - Another good V-Trigger Matchup
    + EX Bull Head/Horn is good
  - Spam VSkill to get V-trigger going quickly
  - Punish teleport with normals
