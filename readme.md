Nothing particularly interesting here, just some notes I'm taking to attempt to improve at Street Fighter V


Notes come from:
* https://youtu.be/ZXPGFmd77AI
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHaFzDM-2y8


Long term plan is to create a sort of `awesome-sfv` repo, with links to good resources / some notes of my own like these repos:

* https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react
* https://github.com/emrehan/awesome-clojurescript
